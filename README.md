**Tested with, working on python 2.7.10, 3.4.3**

##Provenance

Michael Stephens wrote a [demo reconcilliation service](https://github.com/mikejs/reconcile-demo) and Ted Lawless wrote a [FAST reconciliation service](https://github.com/lawlesst/fast-reconcile) that this code modifies and builds off of.

##Special Notes

TBW

##Instructions

Runs directly on localhost:5000 (no /reconcile needed for this recon service)

##Plans for Improvement

Getting to work with skos:altLabels for match points. I WILL GET THAT TO WORK.
